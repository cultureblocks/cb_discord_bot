This is the first thing I've built. Issues and PRs are open, feedback is awesome.

Design:

- Part of CB's intent is to generalize and abstract the foundational pieces of organizing that every group contends with - establishing connections, discovering purpose, managing power, etc. The bot can be used for casual and silly purposes or for advanced teams to work through difficult issues and everything in between.
- There are lots of ideas that didn't make it into this bot either because they were above my skill level, they were too niche for the MVP, or they don't work in this format. These will be further explored using web3 tech.

Free and Pay versions:

- This version is paid for with cultural and informational capital via the connected Blocks channels, which allows everyone using the bot to see how everyone else is using it. That way we can discover interesting ways to use it faster together.
- Private Block channels and custom features can be negotiated.

Contact:

- My tag is @maenswirony here, discord, charmverse, and gmail.
